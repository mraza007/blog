- During my time at `JPMC` I took over several tasks such as adding new features to an existing application and Deployment of `machine-learning` models.
- As intern I worked on adding new features to an existing search engine application that was used to index production issues. The application  stack was based on `SpringBoot`,`Angular for frontend` and `MariaDB`.
